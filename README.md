# HackRU Front-End 


## TL;DR
Hi, this is front-end, it was made with React, we're implementing Redux for reasons, and there's a bunch of other stuff too.  Look at the [Installation Guide](#installation-guide-how-a-mfer-can-get-started), [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Road to Redux](./ROAD_TO_REDUX.md). 
Yahh, Yerr, Yeet, etc.

**A working version of the front end can be viewed [here](http://hackru-frontend.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).**

### We are writing wiki documentation which will contain all the info that used to be on this README.  Stay tuned.
